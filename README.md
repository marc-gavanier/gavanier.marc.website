<h2 id="focus">💼 Professional Focus</h2>

I work as an **independent software engineer**, helping companies design, build, and maintain reliable and maintainable web applications.  
My main areas of expertise include:
- **Full-stack development** with modern stacks (Next.js, TypeScript, React)
- **Clean architecture** and domain-driven design principles
- **API and backend development** (Node.js, Serverless, or custom architectures)
- **Front-end engineering** with a focus on UX, accessibility, and performance
- **Technical mentoring** and architectural guidance for teams

My goal is to combine **technical excellence**, **clear communication**, and **a pragmatic mindset** to deliver lasting value.

- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) + [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com)
